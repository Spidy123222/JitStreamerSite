        <h1>JitStreamer Store is Under Construction</h1>
        <p>
            The dream of JitStreamer is to serve as a platform for iOS
            developers to ship their own apps without Apple's limitations. What
            you see now is the start of that work, but we have a ways to go
            before we see that reality. While you wait, you can use Apple's
            Shortcuts app to launch JIT. For more information, visit
            JitStreamer's Discord server.
        </p>
